# Student Management System

A website which automates the signing up process to voluntary classes. 

- Teachers can add/remove courses and generate custom usernames and passwords for a list of Students. 
- Students can sign in with those credentials and make their choice until a certain date. 
- Special Tokens can be distributed to Students that lead special classes or outside teachers which allow them access to only their class. 
- Data can be imported and exported via .csv files.
